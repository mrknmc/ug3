      "**Note**: I have been able to simulate all branch predictors completely.\n",
      "\n",
      "The purpose of this report is to describe the internal structure of the branch predictor simulators built for this assignment and summarise the experiments performed on them. The language of my choice is Python. I implemented each predictor as a separate function in one file called `pred.py`. The source code for each predictor is presented and I will try to clarify how it works. Furthermore, I wrote a `main` function which just opens the supplied file and runs these functions on it and a helper generator function `parse` which loops over the lines of the file and yields the address and whether the branch was taken or not. It also resets the file pointer after it exits the file loop.\n",

      "### Static Predictor - Always Taken & Always Not Taken\n",
      "In this simulator the branch is always predicted as either taken or not taken. If set correctly it could perform really well on programs that have either lot of branches taken or very few branches being taken for very little cost. Following is the code used for this simulator:\n",
      "    \n",
      "    1. def static_predictor(file, pred):\n",
      "    2.    total, correct = 0.0, 0\n",
      "    3.    for addr, taken in parse(file):\n",
      "    4.        total += 1\n",
      "    5.        correct += taken == pred\n",
      "    6.    return 1 - (correct / total)\n",
      "    \n",
      "Argument `file` is the trace file being used and argument `pred` (set to either 0 or 1) determines whether the branch is always predicted as taken or not taken. Variables `total` and `correct` are both initialised to zero and while `total` is incremented with each branch encountered, `correct` is incremented whenever the prediction is correct. The predictor returns the misprediction rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Profile Guided Predictor\n",
      "This predictor uses a profiling file `file` to determine addresses on which branches are taken more than 50% of the time and predicts those branches as always taken and the rest as not taken. Following is the code for this predictor:\n",
      "\n",

      "     4.    for addr, taken in parse(file):\n",
      "     5.        num_taken, num_found = addr_taken[addr]\n",
      "     6.        addr_taken[addr] = num_taken + taken, num_found + 1\n",

      "    13.    return 1 - (correct / total)\n",
      "        \n",
      "This predictor has two stages:\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 1. Profiling stage: lines 3 - 6\n",
      "In this stage the file is profiled. We create a dictionary `addr_taken` indexed by the address of the branch and for each address we save the number of times it was taken and the number of occurences in the file.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2. Prediction stage: lines 8 - 12\n",
      "In this stage we go through the file again and for each branch instruction we look into the `addr_taken` dictionary to find the percentage of times the particular branch was taken in the profiling stage. If it is more than 50% than we predict that branch as taken otherwise we predict it as not taken. Once again we return the misprediction rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Two-level Adaptive Predictor\n",
      "This predictor maintains a 2-bit finite state machine for each potential history of each branch address. Following is the code for this predictor:\n",

      "    \n",
      "Arguments `file`, `hist_bits`, `state_bits`, `init_state` represent the trace file being used, number of bits used for history, number of states for each finite state machine predictor and the initial state of those predictors, respectively. Dictionary `hists` is used for storing the history for each branch address and the dictionary `preds` is used for storing the predictors initialised to `init_state`. Each branch instruction in the file is then looped over and its history `hist` is retrieved and used to retrieve the state `state` of the predictor associated with the history. If the state of the predictor is one of the taken states, that is greater than half of the number of states, then the branch is predicted as taken and compared with the actual value. Afterwards, the state of the predictor is updated by either incrementing the state if the branch was taken or decrementing it if it was not. History is also updated by adding the last 'taken' value.\n",

      "## Experiments\n",

      "From the misprediction rate being higher for Always Not Taken predictor than Always Taken predictor for both of the files we can deduce that they both contain more branch instructions that were taken than not taken. Furthermore, we can confirm that using more bits for history does improve the performance of the Two-level Adaptive Predictor but since it is exponential in nature and has a high memory overhead"
