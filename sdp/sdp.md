# Introduction

The purpose of this report is to "describe" my contribution to the SDP project for team 2, The Underdogs. As the team leader and most active contributor to the project I believe that my contribution to the project was substantial.

# Team Responsibilities

From the start, I was "active with team responsibilities". I set up a version control repository GitHub [@repo], a task management board on Trello (not public) and a discussion group on Facebook (not public) for our team. Moreover, I wrote a guide for setting up the project on DiCE.

I tried organising meetings regularly even though the turnout was usually not great.

# Project Work



# Lessons Learned

## What would you do differently?

 - It took us too long to realise what things were important, e.g. tests, GUI
 - We did not start simple and added functionality progressively from the start.
 - Have one leader who guides the project from the start.
 - Copy robot design of other teams from the start.

## What worked well?
